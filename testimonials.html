									<p class="m-n"><em>"Great beach house right on the sound which location our family loves. Our kids had a blast fishing and boating off the dock, the sunset views are outstanding, great sunroom for morning coffee and feeling the breeze, lots of fun water toys all in a secluded setting off the main road. The house is laid off perfect for us. Very clean and plenty of room for all 9 of us to enjoy family time upstairs. The kids enjoyed sleeping downstairs in their own little apartment, upstairs the kitchen was the best stocked kitchen we’ve ever had. Perfect for cooking a few nights in. We will definitely stay here again!"</em></p>

									<p class="m-n"><em>"We had a great time. The house is gorgeous and right on the water. It's the perfect spot to watch the sunset and star gaze. It is not far from Frisco beach, where we spent a few hours walking/sitting on the beach. The kitchen is fully equipped. We had everything we needed for our stay. Doug was the perfect host. He was very responsive, answering all my questions. I highly recommend staying here; you won't regret it."</em></p>

									<p class="m-n"><em>"We had a wonderful stay at this house. Our favorite part about the house was having water access in the backyard. Our whole family really enjoyed fishing, walking, and watching sunsets in the back. We also loved the upstairs balcony that had a gate. We brought our small dog and she loved being able to be outside with everyone as well. The kitchen was nice and open, and we loved how many seating options there were so everyone could be spread out comfortably. All of the beds in the rooms were very comfortable. Doug was a very responsive and helpful host to help accommodate us with our stay. The only thing we would change about the house is if we could add interior stairs to the home. Since it rained quite a lot, it made it hard hauling in groceries and luggage in the rain. We also wish the laundry room was a little bit closer, instead of having to take laundry outside each time. Other than that, our stay was amazing and we hope to return to this house next summer. We loved it!"</em></p>
